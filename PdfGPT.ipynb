            "and extend classes while the static class cannot (it can extend classes, but it does not inherit \n",
            "their instance members). If we consider a static class it can only be a nested static  and not \n",

            "Viyaan Jhiingade  | JAVA  • Another advantage of Singleton is that it can be lazily loaded whereas static will be initialized \n",

            "• Singleton object stores in Heap but, static object stores in stack.  \n",
